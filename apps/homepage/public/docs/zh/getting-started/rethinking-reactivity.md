深入探索Reactivity Graph

# Introduction
Reactivity，也就是在数据变化时更新UI的能力，在现代前端框架中是至关重要的。随着前端应用程序在复杂性上的发展，管理可变状态及其对UI的影响变得重要。虽然前端社区为Reactivity设计了各种解决方案，但仍然存在一些常见的问题和挑战：

* 不一致的更新：数据变化与UI更新之间的不一致性可能导致问题。
* 过度渲染：无法精确判断哪些UI部分需要重新渲染可能会导致不必要的计算和DOM操作。
* 依赖管理挑战：在大型应用中，理解和管理各种状态之间的依赖关系变得越来越复杂。
* 调试困难：没有清晰的数据流和更新逻辑，故障排查可能会变得特别耗时。

# Reactivity Graph的概念
当我们思考这些问题时，我们能发现一些规律吗？这些更新、依赖和数据的流动是不是可以构成一个图(graph)？其中，数据状态是节点，而它们的依赖关系则是边，形成了一个网络，只要数据发生变化，就会触发UI的更新。

这就引出了我们今天要深入探讨的主题——“Reactivity Graph”。Reactivity Graph是一个有向的无环图，在这个模型中：
* 节点：代表了一个可以观察和更改的状态。
* 边：表示状态之间的依赖关系。
* 方向：指定数据变化的传播路径。

在这个模型里，每次状态发生变化都会顺着其依赖（也就是边）的方向传播，确保应用中受到影响的部分得到准确的更新，并避免了不必要的渲染和计算。

尽管Reactivity Graph的概念在过去的许多年里已经在多个领域被探索和应用，但其在前端框架中的全面、系统化的实现却尚待完善。这为我们提供了一个机会，去进一步探索和适配这个强大的模型，来解决现代网络开发中关于reactivity和数据流动的问题。

# 构建Reactivity Graph
## 基础的计数示例
考虑一个简单的应用状态，其中我们有`count`，`doubleCount`（其值总是`count`的两倍），以及一个UI元素`first-el`，用来显示count的值。

在我们可视化我们的Reactivity Graph之前，让我们先通过代码来概念化我们的示例。请注意，以下的语法并不特定于任何框架，只是为了以一种易于理解的方式来传达这个思想。

```js
let count = declareState(1);
let doubleCount = declareState(count * 2);
const el1 = document.createElement("div");
el1.id = "first-el";
el1.innerText = declareState(count)
```
一个简化的分解：
* `declareState(0)`: 声明了一个初始值为0的响应式状态count。
* `declareState(count * 2)`: 声明了一个响应式的派生状态doubleCount，其值总是count的两倍。
* `declareState(count)`: 将我们的el元素的内部文本绑定，使其总是显示count的当前值。

现在，让我们将其转化为一个简单的reactivity graph：

![reactivity-graph0](../imgs/reactivity-graph0.jpeg "reactivity-graph0")

在这张图中，节点 (`count`, `doubleCount`, 和 `div: first-el`) 代表我们的状态和UI元素，而边代表它们之间的依赖关系，即：
1. 当 `count` 发生变化时, `doubleCount` 重新计算 **一次** 
2. 当 `count` 发生变化时, `first-el` 重新渲染innerText **一次**

将它们放入一个表格中：

| state | target |
| --- | --- |
| count | doubleCount |
|       | first-el |

可视化是这样的：

![reactivity-graph0-count](../imgs/reactivity-graph0-count.gif "reactivity-graph0-count")

## 增加一层复杂性
让我们修改我们的示例，使`first-el`显示`doubleCount`而不是`count`。我们还需要对JavaScript伪代码进行一些小的修改来反映这一点：
```jsx
let count = declareState(1);
let doubleCount = declareState(count * 2);
let el1 = document.createElement("div");
el1.id = "first-el";
el1.innerText = declareState(doubleCount)
```
Reactivity图会是这样:

![reactivity-graph1](../imgs/reactivity-graph1.jpeg "reactivity-graph1")

这是我们新图中的Reactivity流的示意图：
1. 当 `count` 发生变化时, `doubleCount` 重新计算 **一次** 
2. 当 `doubleCount` 发生变化时, `first-el` 重新渲染innerText **一次**

这是表格版本：
| state | target |
| --- | --- |
| count | doubleCount |
| doubleCount | first-el |

动画版本：

![reactivity-graph1-count](../imgs/reactivity-graph1-count.gif "reactivity-graph1-count")

这里值得讨论的一个重要点是，直接修改派生状态，如我们示例中的`doubleCount`。


根据传统的逻辑，直接修改`doubleCount`可能不会被视为一个操作，因为它是计算上绑定到`count`的（具体是`count` * 2）。但是，让我们转变一下思维：为什么`doubleCount`应该是不可变的？毕竟，它是一个变量，而变量本质上是可变的。所以我更愿意将这类变量称为`derived state`而非`computed state`。

假设我们直接改变`doubleCount`，如`doubleCount ++`。在支持mutable derived states的Reactivity graph中，以下顺序将展开：
1. `doubleCount`增加1，因此，它的新值是3。
2. `doubleCount`的变化触发了`first-el`的重新渲染，更新其显示的值为3。

在这个模型下，任何后续的对`count`的修改都会再次重新计算`doubleCount`，并引发`first-el`的新值的重新渲染。所以如果我们`count++`：

1. `count`增加1，其新值变为2。
2. `doubleCount`重新计算，遵循其定义的逻辑`count * 2`，并更新其值为4。
3. `doubleCount`的变化促使`first-el`重新渲染，显示新的值，4。

## 小节总结及更多复杂性
在上一部分中，我们构建了一些简单的reactivity graph，了解了如何使用这个模型来可视化和管理各种状态及其依赖关系。从简单到复杂的依赖关系，反应性图表已经展示了它直观地描绘和指导应用程序中的状态管理和数据流的能力。

现在，让我们来看一个更复杂的例子，其中包含多个状态和依赖关系，并置于数学逻辑操作的背景下。

想象一下，我们有四个状态：a、b、c、d：

* a: 基础状态，初始值为1。
* b: 依赖于`a`，表示为 `a * 2`.
* c: 依赖于`b`，表示为`b + 1`.
* d: 依赖于`b`和`c`，表示为`b * c`.

以及两个元素：
* el1 => display `a + b`
* el2 => display `d`

现在我们可以得到reactivity graph:

# 将Reactivity Graph融合到前端
将Reactivity Graph应用到前端开发中会引入多种场景，这可能需要对图表进行特定的处理或修改，以确保流畅和高效的反应性管理。

我们之前提到过与Reactivity Graph相关的四个前端问题，它们是：
* 不一致更新
* 过度渲染
* 依赖管理挑战
* 调试困难

在本节中，我们将深入探讨如何策略性地使用Reactivity Graph模型，以应对复杂的前端场景并提供最佳的用户体验。

## Inconsistent Updates
Inconsistent updates refer to the scenario where the UI does not accurately reflect the current application state, causing discrepancies and potentially leading to incorrect data being displayed or processed.

By adhering to the flow of the reactivity graph, the execution becomes inherently robust, safeguarding against inconsistencies in UI updates.

And there's a big part of the updating scenario to be this "side effects" situation. In current frontend frameworks, developers often contend with "side effects," which refer to operations that influence or are influenced by states outside their local environment. These might encompass data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations. Essentially, they are operations that not only derive new data from existing values but also initiate changes that might indirectly affect other parts of the system. The introduction of side effects often complicates the data flow, occasionally leading to the dreaded inconsistent updates, where the UI does not accurately mirror the prevailing application state.
 
In contrast, the reactivity graph methodically extinguishes the concept of side effects, adopting a structure where:
* Every operation, state, or view is encapsulated as a node.
* All influences and dependencies are transparently depicted as edges.

Let’s illustrate this with a concrete example to provide a better understanding.

In conventional front-end frameworks, developers might utilize side effects to, say, log the current state of a variable to the console whenever it alters. Note that the following syntax ISN'T specific to any framework but is written to convey the idea in an understandable manner.
```js
const [count, setCount] = state(0)

effect(() => {
  console.log(count);
}, [count])
```
In this scenario, `effect` operates as a side effect that listens for changes in count and runs a block of code (logging to the console) whenever count alters.

Doing this in a reactivity graph, the traditionally known side effect is essentially translated into a dependent node within the graph structure. Let’s further this with a pseudo-coding approach:
```js
let count = declareState(1)
let logCount = declareState((() => {
    console.log(count);
    return count; // This value can be anything, as the main purpose is the execution of the IIFE.
})());
```
Here:
* `declareState(0)`: Declares a reactive state count, initialized with 0.
* `declareEffect(() => console.log(count))`: This isn't setting up a "side effect" in the traditional sense. Instead, it establishes another state. However, because it's an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE), it executes the logging operation instantly during its declaration. The act of logging here, similar to a "side effect", is performed before a value is returned and the state is finalized. However, within the context of a reactivity graph, this is not viewed or treated as a "side effect" but merely a state with an operation executed during its creation.

In the reactivity graph, it would be visualized as:
![reactivity-graph3](../imgs/reactivity-graph3.jpeg "reactivity-graph3")

In the reactivity graph, everything, including what traditional frameworks might regard as side effects, is treated as nodes. This means there's no explicit "effect" or "side effect" concept; every node has equal footing, and the behavior is based on the relationships (edges) they form with other nodes. This design choice simplifies dependency management, and with every operation being explicit and contained within nodes, there is clarity in data flow and less room for inconsistencies.

## Over-rendering
Over-rendering is one of the most prevalent performance concerns in frontend development. It occurs when parts of the UI are re-rendered without any actual change in the data they represent, leading to unnecessary computational overhead.

The reactivity graph, with its explicit depiction of nodes (states and views) and edges (dependencies), provides a robust countermeasure against over-rendering. Here's how:
1. Explicit Dependency Management: With each node's dependencies clearly marked by edges, there's a lucid picture of what data impacts which part of the UI. This structure ensures that only the affected parts of the UI get re-rendered when a particular data node changes.
2. Optimized Change Propagation: The graph-based model promotes an efficient traversal method. When a node updates, only its direct and indirect dependencies are re-evaluated, sidestepping any unrelated computations.
3. Granular Control over Properties: Developers can exercise finer control by designating specific properties of a view as individual nodes. By doing so, only these properties get updated, negating the need to re-render the entire component. This granularity prevents the waste of resources and significantly boosts performance.

## Dependency Management Challenges
Loop dependencies arise when there's a direct or indirect self-reference causing a reactive state or operation to endlessly trigger itself. Such dependencies can lead to infinite loops, making the application unresponsive or producing unintended results.

In a typical reactive system, this can cause severe issues. However, the reactivity graph is equipped to detect and handle these scenarios more efficiently.

Consider the following pseudo-code example:
```js
let count = declareState(2 / reverseDouble);
let incrementedDoubleCount = declareState((() => {
  count ++
  return count * 2
})());
```
In this case:
* The `incrementedDoubleCount` operation increments count and return its doubled value.
* When `incrementedDoubleCount` is evaluated, it changes count, which in turn changes `incrementedDoubleCount` it self, affecting the value of count again and again and again, which causes a loop dependency.

Reactivity Graph's approach to loop dependency can be descripted as follows:
1. Identification of Loop Point: The reactivity graph identifies potential loop points by locating state nodes that contain both getter (dependencies) and setter (assign) methods.
2. Segmentation into AssignDeps: Once a loop point is detected, all setter methods within the state are isolated and categorized as assignDeps.
3. Filtering Dependencies: The next step involves filtering the dependencies of the node. The updated set of dependencies (deps) for the node becomes:
```text
resolvedDeps = { x | x ∈ deps & x ∉ assignDeps }
```
By using this formula, the reactive system ensures that all setter methods' dependencies (which can potentially introduce loops) are removed from the reactive dependencies of the state.

We can illustrate this approach with:
![reactivity-graph4-0](../imgs/reactivity-graph4-0.jpeg "reactivity-graph4-0")
![reactivity-graph4-1](../imgs/reactivity-graph4-1.jpeg "reactivity-graph4-1")


It's worth noting that loop dependencies are different from circular dependencies. Circular dependencies mean that A depends on B and B depends on A at the same time, which will never happen since:
1. By design, the reactivity graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which means it inherently lacks cycles.
2. In JavaScript, variables must be declared before being referenced.

By using the above steps, the reactivity graph ensures that loop dependencies are effectively handled, preventing infinite loops and ensuring smooth application behavior. 


## Debugging Difficulties
Debugging is a critical aspect of software development, and in complex reactive systems, it can be particularly challenging. One of the main hurdles often faced is the obscurity of data flow, making it tough to pinpoint where things might have gone awry.

However, the reactivity graph provides a solution to this conundrum. Its clear, node-based structure allows for a transparent view of the entire state flow. With this clarity, developers can easily trace the origin of any inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors.

In essence, the reactivity graph simplifies debugging by offering a coherent and lucid overview of the state interactions and dependencies. As a result, developers can swiftly identify and resolve issues, ensuring the smooth operation of the application.

# Summary
In this article, we delved deep into the concept of "Reactivity Graph" and showcased how it can be used to address reactivity issues in frontend applications.

Key Takeaways:
* Concept of Reactivity Graph: A reactivity graph is a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent observable and mutable states, and edges signify the dependencies between states. Through this, any change in data can be propagated accurately, leading to efficient UI updates.
* Challenges in Frontend Development: We outlined four main reactivity challenges faced in frontend development - inconsistent updates, over-rendering, challenges in dependency management, and difficulties in debugging. The reactivity graph offers a structured approach to tackle these issues.

In conclusion, the reactivity graph provides frontend developers with a potent tool to more effectively manage application state and UI changes. By utilizing this approach, developers can build more robust, efficient, and maintainable applications. And as frontend technology continues to advance, we look forward to seeing more innovations and optimizations that make reactivity management even simpler and more efficient.
